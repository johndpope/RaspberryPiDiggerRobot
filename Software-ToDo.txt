-Right hand side thumbstick on mobile not working

-Add password to interface!

-Command values not init'd to sane defaults on client side

-No way to move camera pan on mobile interface

-----

-The bucket angle gauge is stretching the page, probably needs overflow: hidden on container?

-The video does not scale to a larger size on larger screens

-Increase polling frequency of robot volts\amps\temp etc

-On subsequent connects, need to click start video as well as connect?

-The camera eats battery life. Needs a way of turning it off when no client is connected.

-Benchmark PM2 - maybe overkill for an embedded device

-Battery current reading is an instantaneous value, need something server side to poll
 at a much higher rate and then present the average over the websocket connection every second
